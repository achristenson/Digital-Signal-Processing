function Yout = FFTcompression(signal,percentRetained)
% function Yout = FFTcompression(signal,percentRetained)
% This function takes in a signal and a percent of the signal to retain,
% computes the fourier transform and removes the undesired components, and
% returns the FFT of only the percent you want to keep.
% If the percent retained is 90, then the top 90% of the signal will be
% kept.

% Take the Fourier transform
n = 2^ceil(log2(length(signal)));
S = fft(signal,n);

% Find the maximum amplitude of the signal in frequency domain
m = max(abs(S));

% Zero out the weaker frequency components and return the signal
dummy = sort(abs(S));
index = ;
S(abs(S)<=q) = 0;
Yout = S;
