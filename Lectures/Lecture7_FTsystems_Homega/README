<p>As a note, the file &#39;PZ_whyRateOfChangeDependsOnPole.pdf is an &quot;extra&quot; for this lecture.&nbsp; It provides a more detailed look at why the magnitude and phase&nbsp; of&nbsp;$$H(\omega)$$ change more rapidly (as $$\omega$$ changes) as the pole moves closer to the unit circle.</p>

<p>While it is hopefully helpful, the main lecture notes are the other files.</p>
